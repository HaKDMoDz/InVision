A mixed managed / unmanaged game framework for .net / mono

# THIRD-PARTY:
- The library Mono.GameMath was merged into the code so no other assembly reference is needed. 
Anyway, bit thanks for the Mono guys, specially Michael Hutchinson which wrote this library.
Any changes to it will be merged again into the code.

- The rendering engine is provided by the OGRE3D, a really great rendering library in C++.
